Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

- When I request code, provide a fully complete and functional implementation.
Do not include any simulated, dummy, or placeholder code, and do not add comments such as
“This would need more complex implementation…” or any unfinished stubs.
All code must be immediately runnable without requiring further completion.
