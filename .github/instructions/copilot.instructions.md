Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

- When I request code, provide a fully complete and functional implementation.
Do not include any simulated, dummy, or placeholder code.
Do not add comments or statements like “This would need more complex implementation…”, “More complete native implementations can be added later”, or anything implying the code is unfinished or deferred.
All code must be immediately runnable without requiring further completion
