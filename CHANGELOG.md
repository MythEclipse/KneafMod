## Migration Guide

### From 0.9.0 to 1.0.0

#### Configuration Changes
Update your `kneafcore-common.toml` configuration file:

```toml
[kneafcore.performance]
# New configuration options
enableRustOptimizations = true
spatialMaxDepth = 8
entityCloseRadius = 16.0
entityMediumRadius = 32.0
entityCloseRate = 1.0
entityMediumRate = 0.5
entityFarRate = 0.1
useSpatialPartitioning = true
itemMergeRadius = 1.0
itemDespawnTime = 6000
verboseLogging = false
tpsAlertThreshold = 15.0
```

#### API Changes
Update your code to use the new Enhanced Native Bridge:

```java
// Old way (deprecated)
RustPerformance.processEntities(entities);

// New way (recommended)
EnhancedNativeBridge.processBatchAsync(data, result -> {
    // Handle results with callback
    System.out.println("Processed " + result.getProcessedEntities() + " entities");
});
```

#### Error Handling
Update exception handling to use the new exception hierarchy:

```java
try {
    // Your code here
} catch (KneafCoreException e) {
    // Handle specific exceptions with context
    logger.error("Operation failed: " + e.getMessage(), e);
}
```

#### Logging Changes
Update logging configuration for structured JSON output:

```java
// Configure structured logging
PerformanceMetricsLogger.logOptimizations("Performance optimization completed");
```

### Performance Tuning

#### Memory Settings
Adjust JVM settings for optimal performance:

```bash
-Xmx4G -Xms2G -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions
```

#### Native Library Loading
Ensure native libraries are properly loaded:

```java
System.setProperty("java.library.path", "path/to/natives");
NativeLibraryLoader.initialize();
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **Native Library Loading**: Ensure Rust libraries are built and copied to correct location
2. **Memory Issues**: Adjust heap size and garbage collection settings
3. **Performance**: Monitor logs for optimization effectiveness
4. **Compatibility**: Check NeoForge version compatibility

#### Debug Information
Enable debug logging for troubleshooting:

```toml
[kneafcore.performance]
verboseLogging = true
```

## Future Roadmap

- **Version 1.1.0**: Enhanced async processing with better error recovery
- **Version 1.2.0**: Advanced memory management and garbage collection optimization
- **Version 1.3.0**: Distributed processing support for multi-server environments
- **Version 2.0.0**: Complete rewrite with modern Rust async/await patterns
