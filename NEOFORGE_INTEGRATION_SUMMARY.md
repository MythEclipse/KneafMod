# KneafCore NeoForge Event Integration Summary

## Overview
KneafCore has been successfully integrated with NeoForge events to reduce Minecraft server tick time from 100ms to 20ms or less through comprehensive performance optimizations.

## Integration Components

### 1. NeoForge Event Handlers
- **ServerAboutToStartEvent**: Initializes Rust allocator and performance optimizations
- **ServerStartedEvent**: Starts memory management and benchmarking
- **ServerStoppingEvent**: Cleanup and final metrics reporting
- **ServerTickEvent.Post**: Main performance optimization with predictive chunk loading and SIMD operations
- **ChunkEvent.Load**: Tracks chunk loading for predictive optimization

### 2. Performance Optimizations Integrated

#### Predictive Chunk Loading
- Uses player movement prediction to pre-generate chunks
- Integrates with Rust native chunk generation functions
- Reduces chunk loading lag during gameplay
- Configurable prediction radius (default: 3 chunks)

#### Villager Processing Optimization
- Processes villager AI through Rust performance analysis
- Intelligent throttling based on server load
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Integrated with existing PerformanceManager

#### Memory Management
- Automated memory optimization with garbage collection suggestions
- Memory pressure detection and response
- Configurable thresholds (warning: 80%, critical: 90%)
- Background memory monitoring thread

#### SIMD Operations
- Distance calculations using enhanced native bridge
- Entity position processing optimization
- Batch processing for multiple entities
- Leverages Rust SIMD capabilities

### 3. Benchmarking System
- Comprehensive benchmark suite with multiple test scenarios
- Automated performance measurement and reporting
- Comparison between baseline and optimized performance
- Real-time tick time monitoring

## Event Integration Points

```java
@EventBusSubscriber(modid = "kneafcore")
public class NeoForgeEventIntegration {
    @SubscribeEvent
    public static void onServerAboutToStart(ServerAboutToStartEvent event)
    
    @SubscribeEvent
    public static void onServerStarted(ServerStartedEvent event)
    
    @SubscribeEvent
    public static void onServerTick(ServerTickEvent.Post event)
    
    @SubscribeEvent
    public static void onChunkLoad(ChunkEvent.Load event)
    
    @SubscribeEvent
    public static void onServerStopping(ServerStoppingEvent event)
}
```

## Performance Targets
- **Target Tick Time**: ≤ 20ms (from 100ms baseline)
- **TPS Improvement**: Maintain 20 TPS consistently
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduce garbage collection pressure
- **Chunk Loading**: Predictive generation to reduce lag spikes

## Configuration Options
- `kneaf.performance.enabled`: Enable/disable all optimizations
- `kneaf.predictive.chunks`: Enable predictive chunk loading
- `kneaf.villager.optimization`: Enable villager AI optimization
- `kneaf.memory.management`: Enable automated memory management
- `kneaf.simd.operations`: Enable SIMD optimizations
- `kneaf.benchmark.mode`: Enable benchmark mode for testing

## Usage Instructions

### Running Benchmarks
```bash
# Linux/Mac
chmod +x benchmark.sh
./benchmark.sh

# Windows
benchmark.bat
```

### Enabling Optimizations
Optimizations are enabled by default through the PerformanceConfig. Key settings:
- Performance optimizations: Enabled
- Predictive chunk loading: Enabled
- Villager optimization: Enabled
- Memory management: Enabled
- SIMD operations: Enabled

### Monitoring Performance
Performance metrics are automatically logged during server operation:
- Tick time measurements every 100 ticks
- Memory usage monitoring every 30 seconds
- Emergency optimizations when tick time exceeds 50ms
- Final performance report on server shutdown
